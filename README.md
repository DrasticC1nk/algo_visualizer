This program can help you visualize Dijkstra and Dijkstar with A* huristics algo in a GUI written in DirectX11. 

You need to have windows SDK for this to build. 

I might be adding support for more algos. 

Controls: 

    a -> switch algos
    d -> toggle diagonal movement(Chebyshev distance huristic if diagonals are enabled else Manhattan)
    w -> toggle weights(10 and 14 cost for cardinal and diagonal)
    lmb -> set start and end
    rmb -> make walls(can drag)
    ctrl+z -> undo last wall stroke
    r -> reset
    h -> toggle heat map
